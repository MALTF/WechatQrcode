// C++: class SuperpixelSEEDS
/**
 * Class implementing the SEEDS (Superpixels Extracted via Energy-Driven Sampling) superpixels
 * algorithm described in CITE: VBRV14 .
 *
 * The algorithm uses an efficient hill-climbing algorithm to optimize the superpixels' energy
 * function that is based on color histograms and a boundary term, which is optional. The energy
 * function encourages superpixels to be of the same color, and if the boundary term is activated, the
 * superpixels have smooth boundaries and are of similar shape. In practice it starts from a regular
 * grid of superpixels and moves the pixels or blocks of pixels at the boundaries to refine the
 * solution. The algorithm runs in real-time using a single CPU.
